2) how to compare two JSON have the same properties without order?
        var obj1 = { name: "Person 1", age:5 };
        var obj2 = { age:5, name: "Person 1" };
       
       Depending on the type of JSON to be compared, we use different methods:
       Method 1: 
             If the JSON does not have nested objects, then we can us the following method:
             This will work for primitive values
              if(Object.keys(obj1).length==Object.keys(obj2).length){
              for(key in obj1) { 
              if(obj1[key] == obj2[key]) {
              continue;
       
       Methof 2: We need to use stringify and can compare using 
       Lodash isEqual() method is the best way to compare two JSON object.
       This will not consider the order of the keys in object and check for the equality of object
